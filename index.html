        <div class="subheading mb-5">Houston, TX 
        </div>
        <p class="mb-5">Hi there! My name is Alex Paniagua. I am a full-stack software developer with a passion
          for front-end development. I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly web applications and excel at
          collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">A Bit About My Journey:</div>
        <p class="mb-5">My journey into the world of coding began during my freshman year of college in a "Coding for
          Engineers" course. As someone who has always been fascinated by technology, I quickly picked up on coding and
          decided to shift my focus to software development. The ability to create anything from scratch and the vast
          array of tools and frameworks available truly captivated me. What keeps me motivated is the ever-evolving
          nature of this field—there’s always something new to learn and add to my toolkit.
        </p>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">Career Highlights:</div>
        <p class="mb-5">
          One of my proudest achievements was playing a major role in developing a proof-of-concept UX powered by React,
          which was ultimately chosen by leadership to become our main application. This experience not only honed my
          technical skills but also reinforced the importance of innovation and teamwork.
        </p>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">Future Goals:</div>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to more companies and their projects, striving to create the best
          solutions possible. I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to leverage my skills and make a
          meaningful impact.
        </p>
        <div class="subheading mb-3"> My Work Style:</div>
        <p class="mb-5">
          I’m a self-motivated and hardworking individual who is always eager to learn. I thrive in environments where
          collaboration and open discussions are encouraged. I believe that the best solutions come from collective
          brainstorming and thoughtful decision-making based on the overall project goals.

              <p>Part of my coursework at the University of Houston was to work with a team to develop an e-commerce application. After
                explore various tech stacks, we ultimately decided to go with Django, due to its powerful features and ease of use. This application serves
                as the backend framework to handle the essential functionalities of the platform. The project includes a secure
                user authentication system, allowing customers to register,log in and place orders. It supports a
                comprehensive product catalog, featuring categories, product details, and inventory management.
          
                Key features include a dynamic shopping cart, where users can add, remove, and update products, and a seamless
                checkout process. The admin panel is customized to allow
                easy product management, order tracking, and user administration.
          
                To enhance user experience, the application implements responsive design principles, ensuring accessibility across
                various devices. Additionally, we utilized Django's templating engine to create clean and intuitive UI components,
                providing a smooth and engaging shopping experience.

            <p>In a recent project, I decided to recreate wordle, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. To enhance the
              grid components and page dynamism, I integrated Material-UI (MUI).

              I crafted the game's structure with HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean and responsive design. Using
              JavaScript
              and React, I managed the game's logic and state to ensure a smooth, interactive experience. MUI's Grid and
              Box
              components were key in organizing the letter tiles and maintaining consistency across devices.

              One feature I'm particularly proud of is the responsive on-screen keyboard, which adjusts button sizes
              based
              on screen size, making it user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices. I also added animations to
              make
              the game visually engaging.

              This project was a great way for me to demonstrate my front-end development skills and my passion for
              creating
              fun, user-friendly web applications.</p>

            <p>My friends and I were going to Las Vegas, but did not know the rules of any casino games. Roulette in particular, we found
              to be very confusing with the different types of bets and payouts. This inspired me to create a
              very basic roulette betting board application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This
              project was a fun exercise in building a functional web application without relying on any frameworks.

              The goal was to replicate a traditional roulette betting board, allowing users to place bets and see the
              potential payouts. After placing their bets and hitting the calculate button, the application displays the
              payout for each square. I focused on creating a clean and
              intuitive interface using pure HTML and CSS, while JavaScript handled the logic for calculating and
              displaying the payouts.

              This project helped me sharpen my skills in vanilla JavaScript and reinforced the importance of
              foundational web development techniques. It was a rewarding challenge to build a fully functional
              application from scratch, emphasizing simplicity and performance.</p>
